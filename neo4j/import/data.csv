d:1,what is docker?,c:11,docker is a tool that is designed to help developers create and maintain their apps in an easy and organized way. the way that this program achieves it is by utilizing what are known as containers. the developer can simply add his app (and all of the other required data) into the container and transport it to its destination,docker
d:2,what are docker containers?,c:11,docker containers are the tools that docker uses to pack and ship developer’s apps to their target destination,docker
d:3,what are docker ‘images’?,c:11, images are used to create the container within docker. this is done by issuing the “run” command.,docker
d:4,did docker come up with the ‘container’ technology?,c:11,"nope, not at all. docker is actually a semi-new project – there are multiple other development tools that offer containers, same as docker",docker
d:5,"how is docker better than other tools that use containers, then?",c:11," docker utilizes the cloud to run its container-relate operations – something that not many other development tools use. using cloud, docker becomes much more flexible and adaptable to various different scenarios that might come up during the development or shipment processes. this is the main feature for why it is being quite heavily regarded, especially when compared to other container-based developer tools.",docker
d:6,what is a dockerfile?,c:11," a dockerfile is exactly such a set of instructions. developers provided docker with such instructions so that the program could do the job correctly, with those specific parameters in mind",docker
d:7, is the ‘container technology’ reliable?,c:11," the biggest companies in the world (such as google, amazon, intel and so on) use and trust the container technology – this should be the best answer for if containers are a reliable technology to use or not.",docker
d:8,"what are the three main types of docker components?
",c:11,"the client, the host and the registry.",docker
d:9,will you lose all of your work if you accidentally exit a container?,c:11,"no, you won’t lose any information, data and other parameters if you accidentally exit the docker container. the only way to lose your progress would be to issue a specific command to delete the container",docker
d:10, can you use any other files for composing instead of the default yaml?,c:11,"yes, yes you can and there are no clashings or any other types of unwanted occurrences – you can use it without a problem.",docker
d:12, what are ‘namespaces’ use for?,c:11,"basically, namespaces isolate the docker containers from other activities or tampering with them.",docker
d:13,what is the single most important requirement for building a docker container?,c:11,the most important requirement for building a container with docker is the default image. this default image may vary depending on the code that you’re using.,docker
d:14,how does docker manage ‘dockerized nodes’?,c:11,"a dockerized node can be any machine that has docker installed and running. now, when it comes to management, the answer is pretty simple – docker can manage both in-house and cloud-based nodes. so, whether the node exists in the area of the main computer running docker or it’s present on the cloud – it does not matter. docker will manage it without a problem.",docker
d:15,what are the main factors that dictate the number of containers you can run?,c:11,there are basically two factors that might limit the number of containers that you can run – the size of your app and your cpu strength.,docker
d:16, how is docker different from hypervisor?,c:11,"hypervisor requires you to have extensive hardware to function properly, while docker runs on the actual operating system. this allows docker to be exceptionally fast and perform tasks in a fluid manner – something that hypervisor tends to lack.",docker
d:17,"does docker run on linux, macos, and windows?",c:11,you can run both linux and windows programs and excutables in docker containers,docker
d:18,how far do docker containers scale?,c:11,"some of the largest server farms in the world today are based on containers. large web deployments like google and twitter, and platform providers such as heroku run on container technology, at a scale of hundreds of thousands or even millions of containers.",docker
d:19,how do i connect docker containers?,c:11,"
currently the recommended way to connect containers is via the docker network feature",docker
d:20,how do i run more than one process in a docker container?,c:11,"this approach is discouraged for most use cases. for maximum efficiency and isolation, each container should address one specific area of concern. however, if you need to run multiple services within a single container",docker
d:21,what platforms does docker run on,c:11,"linux,microsoft windows,cloud",docker
d:22,how do i report a security issue with docker?,c:11,"if you are a docker enterprise customer, please file a support case. otherwise, please file a support case using the account support form. please include as much information as possible including the repository, image, and tag where you suspect a security issue, your name and email so we can contact you, and any other information you feel is relevant",docker
d:23,is mongodb offered as a hosted service,c:5,yes. mongodb atlas is a cloud-hosted database-as-a-service,mongo
d:24,how does a collection differ from a table?,c:5,"instead of tables, a mongodb database stores its data in collections. a collection holds one or more bson documents. documents are analogous to records or rows in a relational database table. each document has one or more fields; fields are similar to the columns in a relational database table.",mongo
d:25,how do i create a database and a collection?,c:5,"if a database does not exist, mongodb creates the database when you first store data for that database.if a collection does not exist, mongodb creates the collection when you first store data for that collection.",mongo
d:26,how do i define or alter the collection schema?,c:5,"you do not need to specify a schema for a collection in mongodb. although it is common for the documents in a collection to have a largely homogeneous structure, it is not a requirement and to change the structure of the documents in a collection, update the documents to the new structure.",mongo
d:27,does mongodb support sql?,c:5,"not directly, no. however, mongodb does support a rich query language of its own",mongo
d:28,does mongodb support transactions?,c:5,mongodb’s atomic single-document operations already provide transaction semantics that meet the data integrity needs of the majority of applications. ,mongo
d:29,does mongodb handle caching?,c:5,"yes. mongodb keeps most recently used data in ram. if you have created indexes for your queries and your working data set fits in ram, mongodb serves all queries from memory.",mongo
d:30,what is the role of profiler in mongodb?,c:5,mongodb includes a database profiler which shows performance characteristics of each operation against the database. with this profiler you can find queries (and write operations) which are slower than they should be and use this information for determining when an index is needed,mongo
d:31,how do you see the connections used by mongos?,c:5,the following command needs to be used: db._admincommand(“connpoolstats”),mongo
d:32,why are data files so large?,c:5,mongodb does aggressive preallocation of reserved space to avoid file system fragmentation.,mongo
